Exercise 1: Finding Inputs and Appending Text


Steps:


HTML Setup:

Created HTML structure with input elements and spans.
Each input is wrapped within a <div> element with an associated span.
One of the input elements has the attribute name="color", while the others do not.


jQuery Script:

Wrote jQuery script to select all inputs that do not have the name "color".
Used the .each() method to iterate over the selected inputs.
Appended text to the span next to each input.
