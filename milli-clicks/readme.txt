Exercise 3: Counting Milliseconds Between Clicks

Setting up the HTML Structure:

A <p> element is created to serve as a clickable area.
Adding jQuery Code:

Within the jQuery code:

We use $(document).ready() to ensure that the code executes when the DOM is fully loaded.
We define a variable startTime to store the timestamp of the first click.
We attach a click event handler to the <p> element.
Inside the event handler function, we check if startTime is 0. If it is, we set startTime to the current timestamp using Date.now(). If startTime is not 0, we calculate the elapsed time by subtracting the current timestamp from startTime, alert the result, and reset startTime to 0 for the next click.
